\section*{Theoretical part}
Let $X_a = 1$ if $a$ is covered by $C$ and $X=0$ otherwise and let $X=\sum_{a \in V}$ denote the total number of elements covered by $C$. We wish to bound the probability $Pr\left[ X \geq n/2 \right]$ using Chernoff Bound, since the bound yielded by Markov's inequality on this expression is too weak to say anything meaningful. $X$ is a sum of Bernoulli trials with parameters $p_a  \geq p =  1-\frac{1}{e}$. Using this bound for $p_a$ we can apply applying Chernoff bound for sum of Bernoulli variables \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_bound\#Example}} and get:
\begin{align*}
\text{Pr}[X \geq n/2] \geq 1 - e^{-\frac{n}{2p}\left( p-\frac{1}{2} \right)^2} = 1 - e^{-\frac{n}{2-\frac{2}{e}}\left( 1-\frac{1}{e}-\frac{1}{2} \right)^2} \geq 1 - e^{-\frac{1}{2-\frac{2}{e}}\left( 1-\frac{1}{e}-\frac{1}{2} \right)^2} \approx 0.014
\end{align*}
Now, consider a rounded set-cover $C$ produced by the LP program. We wish to bound $\text{Pr}[\text{cost}(C) \leq c \cdot OPT ] = 1 - \text{Pr}[\text{cost}(C) > c \cdot OPT ] $. From Markov's inequality we get
\begin{align*}
\text{Pr}[\text{cost}(C) > c \cdot OPT ] \leq \text{Pr}[\text{cost}(C) \geq  c \cdot OPT_f ] = \text{Pr}[\text{cost}(C) \geq  c \cdot \text{E}[\text{cost}(C)] ] \leq 1/c
\end{align*}
So  $\text{Pr}[\text{cost}(C) \leq c \cdot OPT ] \geq 1-1/c$. Finally by applying union bound we get
\begin{align*}
\text{Pr}[X \geq n/2 \; \land \; c \cdot OPT \geq \text{cost}(C)] = & \; \text{Pr}[X < n/2 \; \lor \; c \cdot OPT < \text{cost}(C)] \\
\leq &\;1 - 0.014 + 1 - 1/c = 2 - 0.014-1/c\\
= & \; O(1)
\end{align*}
showing that the event occurs with constant probability.

\section*{Implementation part}
\subsection*{2.1 CPLEX}

\subsection*{2.2 Rounding}

\subsection*{2.3 Third Method}
The implemented metaheuristic uses a hill-climbing (valley descent) approach to determine a local minimum. The approach initialises a valid set cover and greedily removes the most costly set while maintaining feasibility until no more sets can be removed. Two approaches of producing initial feasible solutions were tested: 1) in which a set was picked uniformly at random for each vertex and 2) in which all sets were picked initially. 1) was made with the idea of adversarial situations in mind, in which input instances might foil the greedy approach used by the algorithm, however approach 2) produced much better results and was chosen instead. Our implementation thus lacks the ability to foil adversaries and 'escape' local minimums, which could be remedied by the introduction of random choices. Enlarging the neighborhood to occasionally include infeasible solutions would also seem worthwhile, however both of these strategies call for more sophisticated heuristics, e.g. simulated annealing. The results of the heuristic can be seen in Table \ref{times} - we were surprised how well the heuristic managed to find good covers.
